                <h1>Programming</h1>
                <p>Programming refers to a technological process for telling a computer which tasks to perform in order
                    to solve problems. You can think of programming as a collaboration between humans and computers, in
                    which humans create instructions for a computer to follow (code) in a language computers can
                    understand. Programming enables so many things in our lives, such as:

                    <li>The programming behind apps can make it easy to order food, book a rideshare service, track your
                        fitness, access media, and more.</li>

                    <li>Programming helps businesses operate more efficiently through different software for file
                        storage and automation and video conferencing tools to connect people globally.</li>

            <p>
                JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web
                pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to
                look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video
                jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer
                cake of standard web technologies, two of which <i>(HTML and CSS)</i> we have covered in much more
                detail in

                    Web development, also known as website development, refers to the tasks associated with creating,
                    building, and maintaining websites and web applications that run online on a browser. It may,
                    however,
                    also include web design, web programming, and database management.

                    Web development is closely related to the job of designing the features and functionality of apps
                    (web design). The term development is usually reserved for the actual construction of these things
                    (that is to say, the programming of sites).

                    be
                    done “from scratch” by writing code. A number of <i>content management systems (CMS)</i> fall into

                    sure they functioned properly and performed in ways that allowed for a great user experience. Web
                    Developers do this by writing lines of code, using a variety of programming languages, which vary
                    depending on the tasks they are performing and the platforms they are working on.

                A website is a place on the internet where you can keep information for others to see. This can be
                information about yourself, your business, or even topics of your interest. Based on the website
                category, people can also use them to shop, chat, study, and get entertained.

                <br>
                Simply put, when you enter a web address into your browser, it goes to that specified location and
                retrieves the web page. The process of retrieving this information is carried out by a web service using
                technologies such as <a href="index.html"><b>Hypertext

                Knowing a website’s essential elements will help you better understand its technology. In addition,

                                Simply put, the definition of web hosting refers to a web host providing website owners

                                name is important to your website-building journey.

                                Typically, a URL comprises different parts, including a protocol, a domain name, an
                                extension, and a path.

                                explore more and visit again. In fact, more than 80% of visitors judge a business’s
                                credibility based on its website design.

                    Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development,
